#  DoDo3D

DoDo3D Commander is software developed to help handle everyday 3d print farm management with minimal requirements.  Its design is to be a simple yet effective way of handling the mundane task associated with 3d printing.

The interface (for now) is command line, but mostly automated so you donâ€™t have to continually monitor.

We use netcat to handle the majority of our server commands and serves as a simple yet effective way of communicating with our printers.

Commander is built to be utilized with ESP3D devices eliminating the need for extra cables or expensive hardware.  By opening up the possibilities of microcontroller control, we now have an excellent platform to build on!

Please see the list of capabilities and requirements for ESP3D here:

Version 3.x is recommended as it contains many new features taken advantage of.
